## Dataset 📊

This dataset is a simplified and enriched view of the data in the Bitcoin blockchain. In the original Bitcoin Blockchain data, transactions are between anonymous addresses. Multiple addresses can belong to the same Entity (Actor) (person, company...), and a unique Transaction can actually contain multiple payments to multiple addresses and Entity. 

## Project Execution 🚀

- Install the necessary packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Run the project
```bash
python app.py
```
📝 Please note that due to the large size of the dataset, the pages for representation and clustering may take some time to display the graphs. ⌛
